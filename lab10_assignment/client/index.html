<!--
    Create a landing (home) page (25 points)
        It should fit the theme of your application
        Pictures are always nice
        It should have links (or buttons) to the other pages on the website.
        A landing page URL would end at the domain (.com. localhost:4500, etc) without need for a / after.  The app.get would then have "/" as its listener.  For example: app.get('/', function(req, res) {...});

    Add the ability to delete a record (50 points)
        An option:
            Add buttons (or links) to the "browse-library" table (one for each row) that will call a delete function (feeding it the ID of the record). 
                Hint: we (will have) covered a way to put "data-" fields in a page element (in this case a button).  This can also be done when creating the table dynamically.  That field can contain the ID of the record for that row.
        The AJAX call to the server will need to include the ID the record being deleted.
        This will require a new DELETE service to be created on the server.

    Extra Credit (30 Points): 
    Change your "browse-library" page to give the user the ability to sort the records by ID, and at least 2 other fields (that make sense).  For example:  sort by Book Title, sort by Author, sort by Publisher, etc.
        Some Options (there probably are others):
            There are jQuery functions/stylings (but not in the default jQuery I think) that allow you to create the sort fields on the header and take care of things for you with no other effort.  You would have to do some research on this.
            Create a dropdown box or set of option buttons for the user to select the sort type.  Then include a refresh button that calls to the server and feeds the sort option.  Sort the data on the server and return to the client already sorted (the table will need to be redrawn upon AJAX success).
