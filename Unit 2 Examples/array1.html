  <h1>Arrays</h1>
  An array is a group of variables that have the same name and type. Use an array index (integer) to access an element of the array. Array indexes start at 0. The .length property provides the size of the array.
  
  <script>
    colors = ["red","orange","yellow","green","blue","indigo","violet"];
    console.log( "The first element is: " + colors[0] );
    console.log( "The last element is: " + colors[6] );
    console.log( "The last element is: " + colors[colors.length-1] );
