  <h1>Arrays</h1>
  Since an array has a sequential index, an array works well with a FOR loop.
  
  <script>
    colors = ["red","orange","yellow","green","blue","indigo","violet"];
    var i;
    console.log("The colors of the rainbow are:");
    for (var i=0; i < colors.length; i++) {
      console.log( colors[i] );
    }
    
  </script>
