  <h1>2D Arrays</h1>
A two-dimensional(2D) array is an array of arrays. In other words, it is an array where each element is also an array.<br><br>

Arrays have rows and columns. Each row is an array. Each element of that array is the column.<br><br>

Since a 2D array is an array of arrays, it requires 2 indexes. The first index specifies which array. The second index specifies which element of that array.<br><br>

    //a 2D array that has three rows and four columns
    var arr = [ ['a','b','c','d'] , ['e','f','g','h'] , ['i','j','k','l'] ];
    
    //arr has three elements (i.e., arrays)
    console.log('arr has length ' + arr.length); //3
    
    //print out 'h', which is at row 1 and column 3
    console.log(arr[1][3]); //'h'
    
    //print out 'i', which is at row 2 and column 0
    console.log(arr[2][0]); //'i'
    
    //print out all rows and columns using two FOR loops
    var s = '';
    for (var row=0; row < arr.length; row++) {
      for (var col=0; col < arr[row].length; col++) {
        s = s + arr[row][col] + ' ';
      }
      s = s + '\n';
    }
    console.log(s);
