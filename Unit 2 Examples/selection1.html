  <h1>Selection - IF Statements</h1>
  <p>The IF-THEN and IF-TEN-ELSE statements implement selection in JavaScript.</p>
  <p>The IF-THEN statement executes a statement or block of statements if its condition is true.</p>
  <p>The IF-THEN-ELSE statement executes a statement or block of statements if its condition is true and executes a different statement or block of statements if its condition is false.</p>

  <script>
    var age = 19;

	//The IF-THEN statement
    //Note: if only one statement is to be executed, the closing bracket is optional.
	//If there is more than one statement to be executed, the closing bracket is required.
    if (age > 18) {
      console.log("You CAN vote!");
    }  
    

    //The IF-THEN-ELSE statement
	//Use when there are actions to execute when the condition is true AND when the condition is false
    if (age < 18) {
      console.log("You CANNOT vote!");  //Execute this block of code if condition is true
    } else {
      console.log("You CAN vote!");     //Execute this block of code if condition is false
    }
  </script>
