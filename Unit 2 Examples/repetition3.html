  <h1>Repetition - DO-WHILE</h1>
  <p>Repetition is the process of repeating a statement or block of statements in a program.</p>
  <p>The DO-WHILE loop is one way to implement repetition. This loop is useful when you need to repeat a statement or block of statements while a Boolean condition is true. View the console to see the output.</p>
  
  <script>
  //print all numbers from 0 - 100 that are divisible by 17
  number = 0;
  do {
    if (number % 17 == 0)
      console.log(number);
    number = number + 1;
  } while (number <= 100);
