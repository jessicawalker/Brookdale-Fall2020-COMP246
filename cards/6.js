Homework 6: Cards
*/

/*
Write a Node.js program that does the following:

Save the program to a file named 6.js .

Create a standard deck of 52 cards (e.g., "As", "2s", "3s", ... , "Td", "Jd", "Qd", "Kd"). Note that you must use T (not 10) to indicate the rank Ten.

Deal ten unique, random cards to two players, alternating the deal.

Compare the two five-card poker hands and determine the winner.

Use the poker-evaluator (Links to an external site.) npm library to evaluate the two poker hands.
Save the poker-evaluator npm module; generate the package.json and package-lock.json files to save the external library information.

Submit 6.js, package.json, and package-lock.json to Canvas.

You must format your output like below:

    $ node 6.js
    Hand 1: Qs 7c Kd 2h 8c  high card
    Hand 2: Ad 6d 4h Jd Ah  one pair

    Hand 2 wins!
